I enjoy running workshops and teaching .I am a leader, developer,mentor and an active contributor to my campus community.I’m interested in Web devlopment and Competitive Coding. I’m currently learning Web dev & data structures. Being a Technophide , I am quite fasicnated by advancing technologies and I love to connect, build , learn, share and explore all dimensions of my interests. I love contributing to the open source and I have been an active part of programs such as Girlscript Winter of Contributing, etc.I’m looking to collaborate on the projects related to web dev and data structures.
